## Workflow
Home Page
- The practitioner is asked to login using their Gmail id. 
- There is no registration--the Administrator has to create the practitioner.
- After verification, the practitioner lands on the home page. They will see the following options:
	- Invite User button: The practitioner will get a one-time link to invite a user to take the test. They can send an automated link to invite a user via mail.
	- Activity of previous tests or reports: The practitioner will be able to see the status of all the test takers they have previously invited. This includes 2 types of test-takers.
		- Those who have completed the test: They will see the 'Generate Report' button for these users. They will be able to search for reports using either Name or Date feature of the test report generated.
		- Those who have been invited, yet haven't taken the test: Practitioners can see when they invited the user, and get an option to 'Remind' user by sending an automated follow-up mail to remind them to complete the test.

## Additional Features
Q. What if a practitioner has invited 2 people with the same name to take a test?

A. This is a low-probability situation. If then, the practitioner can search by both name, or date when looking for previous test reports.

Q. How will the practitioner be notified when a user has completed the test?

A. The practitioner will receive an automated mail on their eum.lenses mail id when the user submits their test. They will also be able to generate the user's report after signing in on their profile page.
